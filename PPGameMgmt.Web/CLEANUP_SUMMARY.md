# PPGameMgmt Web Codebase Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to clean up the PPGameMgmt Web codebase.

## Completed Changes

### 1. Consolidated API Layer

- Created a unified API hook factory in `core/api/hookFactory.ts`
- Implemented standardized API hooks for players, games, and bonuses using the factory
- Centralized cache keys and stale times in `core/api/cacheConfig.ts`
- Removed deprecated API client code

### 2. Consolidated Error Handling

- Created a unified error handling system in `core/error/errorUtils.ts`
- Updated imports to use the new error handling utilities
- Deprecated the old error handling utilities in `shared/utils/errorHandling.ts`

### 3. Unified Theme System

- Created a unified theme system in `core/theme/theme.ts`
- Removed the deprecated theme file in `utils/theme.js`
- Updated imports to use the new theme utilities

### 4. Standardized Component Structure

- Implemented a consistent component folder structure for key components:
  - `PlayerCard`
  - `GameCard`
  - `BonusCard`
- Each component now follows this structure:
  ```
  ComponentName/
    ├── ComponentName.tsx
    ├── ComponentName.test.tsx
    └── index.ts
  ```

### 5. Consolidated Development Utilities

- Created a unified development utilities module in `core/dev/renderTracker.ts`
- Moved `useRenderTracker` from `shared/hooks` to `core/dev`
- Updated imports to use the new development utilities

6. **Improved Development Experience**: Consolidated development utilities make it easier to debug and optimize the application
7. **Consistent Component Structure**: Standardized component structure makes it easier to navigate and understand the codebase

## Next Steps

1. **Update Remaining Imports**: Continue updating imports across the codebase to use the new consolidated utilities
2. **Standardize More Components**: Apply the standardized component structure to more components
3. **Remove More Deprecated Code**: Continue removing deprecated code and duplicate utility functions
4. **Add More Tests**: Add tests for the new utilities and hooks
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the application for performance
6. **Accessibility Improvements**: Improve accessibility across the application
