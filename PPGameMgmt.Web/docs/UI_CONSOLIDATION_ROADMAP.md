# UI Component Library Consolidation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan and timeline for consolidating our UI components into a centralized library at `src/lib/ui` that extends shadcn/ui with application-specific enhancements.

## Current Status

We've completed the initial setup and proof of concept:

- ✅ Created centralized UI component library structure in `src/lib/ui`
- ✅ Established component categories (navigation, layout, inputs, feedback, data-display)
- ✅ Migrated example components (SearchInput, BackButton, StatusBadge)
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation and migration guide
- ✅ Implemented deprecation strategy for old components
- ✅ Created migration script to identify deprecated component usages

## Phase 1: Initial Migration (Week 1-2)

### Goals
- Migrate all remaining components from `src/shared/components/ui-kit`
- Update documentation with all available components
- Run migration script and update at least 3 feature components

### Tasks
1. Migrate remaining `ui-kit` components by category:
   - **Navigation**: Breadcrumbs, Pagination, etc.
   - **Layout**: TabsContainer, Section, PageContainer, etc.
   - **Inputs**: FormFields, FilterDropdown, ActionButtons, etc.
   - **Feedback**: LoadingState, ErrorDisplay, EmptyState, ConfirmationDialog, etc.
   - **Data Display**: VirtualizedList, Table, Metrics, List, Grid, etc.

2. For each component:
   - Refactor to use centralized UI library imports
   - Add proper documentation and examples
   - Apply deprecation pattern to old component

3. Run migration script to identify usage in features
4. Update 3+ feature components to use the new library

## Phase 2: Feature Migration (Week 3-4)

### Goals
- Update all feature-specific components to use centralized library
- Identify and merge duplicate feature-specific components
- Complete 50% of import migrations

### Tasks
1. Review feature-specific components for:
   - Components that should be moved to the centralized library
   - Components that should remain feature-specific but use library primitives
   - Duplicated components that can be consolidated

2. Update feature-specific components to use library primitives

3. Run migration script weekly to track progress

4. Document feature-specific component patterns and best practices

## Phase 3: Full Adoption (Week 5-6)

### Goals
- Complete 100% of import migrations
- Remove deprecated component implementations
- Establish component development workflow

### Tasks
1. Complete all remaining import migrations

2. Remove deprecation warnings and update imports in all files

3. Create component development workflows:
   - Component creation template/CLI
   - Testing patterns for components
   - Documentation generation

4. Final verification and cleanup

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Migration Process

For each component:

1. Review the existing implementation
2. Create the enhanced version in the appropriate category directory
3. Add proper JSDoc comments and examples
4. Update the category's `index.ts` file to export the component
5. Create a deprecation wrapper for the old component
6. Add to the migration script

### Quality Standards

All migrated components should:

- Be fully typed with TypeScript
- Include comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- Have usage examples
- Support proper accessibility patterns
- Be responsive by default

### Deprecation Timeline

- **Phase 1-2**: Old components show deprecation warnings but work via pass-through
- **Phase 3**: All imports updated to use new library
- **Post-migration**: Old component files removed

## Success Criteria

- All UI components properly categorized and documented
- No duplicate component implementations
- Clear guidelines for which components to use when
- All imports updated to use the new library
- Migration script reports zero deprecated component usages
